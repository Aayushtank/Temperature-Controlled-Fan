## A. GitHub Repository Link
(Provide the repository URL here after pushing)

## B. Brief Description
Simple embedded example using Arduino to blink an LED. This project demonstrates:
- Basic I/O with `digitalWrite()` and `pinMode()`
- Timing using `delay()`
- GitHub-based QA: issues, comments, branches and pull requests

## C. Files
- `src/LED_blink.ino` — Arduino sketch to blink an LED
- `docs/circuit_diagram.png` — wiring diagram (add this)
- `docs/report.md` — short report for Moodle
- `QA/ISSUES_LOG.md` — list of logged QA issues and status

## D. Hardware Required
- Arduino UNO (or compatible)
- LED + 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard & jumper wires
- USB cable for Arduino programming

## E. Circuit
- LED anode -> digital pin 13 (through 220Ω resistor)
- LED cathode -> GND

(Attach a small image `docs/circuit_diagram.png`)

## F. How to Run
1. Open `src/LED_blink.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Select the appropriate board (Arduino UNO) and COM port.
3. Upload the sketch.
4. The LED will blink ON for 500 ms, OFF for 500 ms (default).

## G. QA Process Summary
- QA issues tracked in GitHub Issues.
- Fixes developed on feature branches, tested, and merged via pull requests.
- Example issue list available: `QA/ISSUES_LOG.md`.

## H. Learning Outcomes
1. Hands-on with microcontroller I/O and timing.
2. Practiced GitHub workflows: issues, branches, PRs and code review.
3. Documented QA lifecycle for embedded code.
